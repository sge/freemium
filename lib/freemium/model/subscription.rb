# == Attributes
#   subscribable:         the model in your system that has the subscription. probably a User.
#   subscription_plan:    which service plan this subscription is for. affects how payment is interpreted.
#   paid_through:         when the subscription currently expires, assuming no further payment. for manual billing, this also determines when the next payment is due.
#   billing_key:          the id for this user in the remote billing gateway. may not exist if user is on a free plan.
#   last_transaction_at:  when the last gateway transaction was for this account. this is used by your gateway to find "new" transactions.
